# my-deep-learnings

Repository to keep track of my exploration, experiments and understanding in the field of machine and deep learning.

- Delving into the theory : Original paper(s) (if available), relevant cited works and blogs.
- Code implementation of the ideas.

## Computer Vision 👁️

### Architectures

1. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
2. Fast RCNN
3. Mask RCNN
4. U-Net

> From coarse grained to fine grained CV tasks explored : 

1. Image Classification (Single/Multi-label)
2. Object Detection (and Localization)
3. Semantic Segmentation
4. Instance Segmentation
5. Pose Estimation

Classification/segmentation is most common in vision based applications.

Regression in the context of images (or video frames) refers to predicting a continuous value for the target for e.g. detecting the human pose involves outputting the location of several skeletal keypoints such as (x,y).
