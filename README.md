# my-deep-learnings
Repository to keep track of my experiments, exploration and understanding in the field of machine and deep learning.

## Neural Networks

1. Tensors
2. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
3. Backpropagation

## Computer Vision

> Coarse grained to fine grained problems in CV domain are as follows : 

1. Image Classification (Single/Multi-label)
2. Object Detection (and Localization)
3. Semantic Segmentation
4. Instance Segmentation
5. Pose Estimation

Classification/segmentation is most common in vision based applications.

Regression in the context of images (or video frames) refers to predicting a continuous value for the target for e.g. detecting the human pose involves outputting the location of several skeletal keypoints such as (x,y).

## Natural Language Processing

## Frameworks used for exploration :

1. PyTorch
2. fastai
3. TensorFlow
4. keras
